# HaskellFancyTextMe

Just a simple Haskell Programm which counts the number of Char on a String and creates a ranking.

### Update: Try v1 which is a ONE-LINE version of TextMe.

## How it Works

* open 	`ghci`
* `:l text_vX.hs`
* `textMe "MY_FANCY_STRING"`

## Do you want the best and the worst?
just call `top` and `worst`

ex: 
 * `let result = textMe "MY_FANCY_STRING"`
 * `top 10 result   -- to get the top 10 `
 * `worst 10 result -- to get the worst 10 `
